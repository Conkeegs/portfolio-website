            My first dive into programming started about three and a half years ago, with major influence to start coming from my older brother, who is also a programmer. 
            Not only did the ability to create whatever I wanted pique my interest, but the sheer logic of programming, in general, interested me. It allowed me to tell
            my computer exactly what to do in a consistent, specific way, without deviation from the norm and I liked the sound of it all. Because of the oportunity to think
            logically while writing code, combined with my appreciation for the creativity that comes with art and design, I have found web and mobile development to be a perfect 
            fit. It's become outlet for me to take things slowly, plan, catalog, sketch, and create.

            As of now, I live in Rexford, New York, on a path to graduating from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree of science in Web & Mobile Computing. 
            On the side, I of course love to practice my programming skills every day and make sure I'm always learning, but I do have a few other hobbies I love. One of my biggest 
            side hobbies is drawing and sketching, something which I've practiced ever since I was a child. I also take interest in writing and game development, two hobbies that I've 
            always felt blend well together (though my writing interest is more theory-based to be honest). I like to mix it up and keep a sort of variety in my hobbies, as I belive that
            is the key to a happy life.
