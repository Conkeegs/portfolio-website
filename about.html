            My first dive into programming started about three and a half years ago, with major influence to start coming from my older brother. Not only did
            the ability to create whatever I wanted pique my interest, but the sheer logic of programming, in general, interested me. It allowed me to tell
            my computer exactly what to do in a consistent, specific way, without deviation from the norm, and I liked the sound of it all. I tend to take a very methodical approach to this
            passion of mine and learn the basics as much as I can. For someone who likes to take things slowly, plan, and catalog like me, programming is a perfect fit.

            As of now, I live in Rexford, New York, on a path to graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Web & Mobile Computing. On the side, I of course love
            to practice my programming skills every day and make sure I'm always learning, but I do have a few other hobbies I love. One of my biggest side hobbies is drawing and sketching, something
            which I've practiced ever since I was a child. I also take interest in writing and game development, two hobbies that I've always felt blend well together (though my writing interest is more 
            theory-based). I like to mix up and keep a sort of variety in my hobbies (focusing solely on programming would probably take a massive toll on my health to be honest, as much as I love it).
